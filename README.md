# AutoBE Agent Playground

[https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe)

AutoBE Agent is currently being set up. Please wait a moment.

Once the setup is complete, you can create backend applications by conversing with the AutoBE agent.

All programming code generated by the AutoBE agent will be automatically saved in the `result` directory.

## Example Usage

The following are example scripts used to create a [BBS (Bulletin Board System)](https://stackblitz.com/github/wrtnlabs/autobe-example-bbs):

1. I want to create a political/economic discussion board. Since I'm not familiar with programming, please write a requirements analysis report as you see fit.
2. Design the database schema.
3. Create the API interface specification.
4. Make the e2e test functions.
5. Implement the API functions.
