AutoBE Agent is currently being set up. Please wait a moment.

Once the setup is complete, you can create backend applications by conversing with the AutoBE agent.

All programming code generated by the AutoBE agent will be automatically saved in the `result` directory.

## Example Usage

1. I want to create a political/economic discussion board. Since I'm not familiar with programming, please write a requirements analysis report as you see fit. The report should be approximately 3 pages long.
2. "Design the database schema"
3. "Create the API interface specification"
