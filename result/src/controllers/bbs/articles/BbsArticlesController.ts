   * required fields, such as writer name, password (secure/encrypted), and
   * creation time. The body and title are stored in the initial record in
   * 'bbs_article_snapshots', while attached files are related via

   * be encrypted in storage. Ensure all fields follow validations in the DB
   * schema, such as non-empty strings for essential fields, proper format for
   * UUIDs, and file URL validation. The operation is atomic—all-or-nothing if
   * file/attachment data is invalid.
