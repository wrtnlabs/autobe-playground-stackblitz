   * comment's content. If files are attached, relevant mapping records are
   * also created in bbs_article_comment_snapshot_files and attachment_files.
   *
   * Enforces password hashing, IP logging, timestamp recording, and
   * initializes all evidence features.
   *
   * Handles validation errors (missing fields), permission enforcement, and
   * ensures parent entities exist (article, parent comment if reply).
   * Responds with the created comment structure, including snapshot
   * references and attachment linkage.
   *
   * @param articleId Target article ID (UUID) in bbs_articles
   * @param body Comment creation input for bbs_article_comments, including
   *   parentId, writer, password, and initial content.
