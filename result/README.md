## Project Structure

This template project has categorized directories like below.

As you can see from the below, all of the Backend source files are placed into the [src](src/) directory. When you build the TypeScript source files, compiled files would be placed into the `lib` directory following the [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) configuration. Otherwise you build client [SDK](#32-sdk) library for npm publishing and their compiled files would be placed into the [packages](packages) directory.

  - [packages/api/](packages/api): SDK module built by `npm run build:api`
  - [src/](src): Backend source directory
    - [src/api/](src/api/): Client SDK that would be published to the `@ORGANIZATION/PROJECT-api`
      - [**src/api/functional/**](src/api/functional/): API functions generated by the [`nestia`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia)
      - [**src/api/structures/**](src/api/structures/): DTO structures
    - [src/controllers/](src/controllers/): Controller classes of the Main Program
  - [**test/**](test): Test Automation Program
    - [test/features](test/features): List of test functions
  - [nestia.config.ts](nestia.config.ts): Configuration file of [`nestia`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia)
